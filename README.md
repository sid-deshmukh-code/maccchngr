# maccchngr
This Bash script captures the current MAC address of the "eth0" network interface, generates a random MAC address by combining a random OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and a random UAA (Universally Administered Address) part, and then sets the network interface's MAC address to the generated value using the "macchanger" tool.
